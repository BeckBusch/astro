            <p>There are a number of factors that affect the climate of the earth, including the tilt of the earth, the earth's rotation, and the earth's orbit around the sun. when combined, cycles like these cause the day and night cycle, the lengths of
                the days, and the seasons which, have an overall effect on the temperature of the earth.

                <p>The first cycle that I will talk about is the spin of the earth. The earth is constantly spinning around its axis which causes the part of its surface which faces the sun to be constantly changing. Therefore, any part of the earth's surface
                    spins in and out of the sun's light every 24 hours. If the earth did not spin, day and night would be determined by the earth's orbit of the sun, leading to 6 month days and 6 month nights.The length of the day-night cycle is determined
                    by the speed that the earth spins at. The faster the spin, the less time a full rotation would take and therefore the days would be shorter.
                </p>
                <p>However changing the speed at which the earth spins would not affect the earth's temperature. When new zealand is in day, UV and Infra Red radiation hit the earth along with the sun's light. This causes surface temperatures to rise. However
                    at night, the lack of this radiation causes the heat to dissipate. This constant heating and cooling keep the average temperature in equilibrium.
