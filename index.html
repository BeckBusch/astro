        <p>There are a number of factors that affect the climate of the earth, including the tilt of the earth, the
            earth's rotation, and the earth's orbit around the sun. when combined, these cause the day and night cycle,
            control the length of the day, and cause the seasons. All of which have an overall effect on the temperature
            of the earth.

            <p>
                The first cycle that I will talk about is the spin of the earth. The earth is constantly spinning around
                its axis which causes the part of its surface which faces the sun to be constantly changing. Therefore,
                any part of the earth's surface spins in and out of the sun's light every 24 hours. If the earth did not
                spin, day and night would be determined by the earth's orbit of the sun, leading to 6 month days and 6
                month nights.
                The length of the day-night cycle is determined by the speed that the earth spins at. The faster the
                spin, the less time a full rotation would take and therefore the days would be shorter.
            </p>
            <p>
                However changing the speed at which the earth spins would not affect the earth's temperature. When new
                zealand is in day, UV and Infra Red radiation hit the earth along with the sun's light. This causes
                surface temperatures to rise. However at night, the lack of this radiation causes the heat to dissipate.
                This constant heating and cooling keep the average temperature in equilibrium.

        <p>
            The second cycle is the tilt that the earth spins on. The earth spins at a 23.5 degree tilt relative to its
            orbits of the sun. and because of this, the day lengths in opposing hemispheres are different lengths. This
            is because the day/night line is at 0 deg relative to the sun so the tilt causes one hemisphere of earth to
            face away from the sun more than the other. This causes the one to spend longer in the night side, and the
            other to spend longer on the day side. The hemisphere of earth that spends longer in light can heat up more
            and cool down less than the hemisphere that spends longer in darkness. This inequality in the heat/cooling
            is what gives us our seasons.

                Orbit of the Earth

        </div>
        <div id="text">
        <p>
            The third cycle is the orbit of the earth around the sun which, along with the tilt of rotation, is
            responsible for the seasons. The earth's orbit changes which of earth's hemispheres the tilted axis faces
            towards the sun and which hemisphere is faced away. The constant change of the seasons leads to a neutral
            heating on the earth, the same way that the heating from day and cooling from night neutralize each other,
            heating in summer and cooling in winter equalise the net temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth mentioning that while daylight hours are the cause of summer and winter in the sense of
            amount of light, there is another factor that gets in the way of the temperature change. Because the earth
            is a sphere, the further up or down from the equator you go, the smaller the angle at which the sun's light
            hits you becomes. For example a book held parallel to you takes up a certain amount or your vision but, if
            you tile the book away from you, the book takes up less of your vision. For earth, this means that the
            further north or south your go, the more the ground is ‘tilted’ and the less of the sun's energy hits the
            surface.

        <p>
            These cycles work together to create fluctuations in the earth's temperature that we know as the seasons.
            While the spin cause temperature changes between day and night, the tilt causes an imbalance in the day and
            night cycle which the orbit turns into the seasons. In conclusion, the cycles are dependent on one another
            to keep the patterns on earth the same.
